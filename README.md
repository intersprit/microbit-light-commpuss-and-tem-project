# Microbit Compass Exercise

This demonstration of the micro:bit compass uses a laser-cut wooden compass rose to show degrees and cardinal directions.

Students can use the compass rose to help translate heading information from the micro:bit's onboard compass/magnetometer into cardinal directions using MakeCode or MicroPython. The sample programs provided turn the micro:bit LED array into a digital compass needle.

## Learning Objectives
With this project, students will learn how to:
* determine the orientation of the micro:bit in real space using the onboard compass/magnetometer
* use the micro:bit LED array to show directional arrow or clock images
* translate degree headings to cardinal directions
* use a laser cutter/engraver

## Project Files
* [microbit-compass.py](microbit-compass.py) - a MicroPython implementation of a simple compass needle
* [microbit-compass.js](microbit-compass.js) - a Javascript implementation of the compass needle that's compatible with MakeCode
* [Microbit Compass Rose.ai](Microbit%20Compass%20Rose.ai) - an AI file with a 24 in x 12 in layout of eight compass roses. Suitable for printing on a Epilog Mini.

## Compass Rose Tips
I used 1/8" or 3mm plywood for the compass rose. This allows the micro:bit buttons to sit nearly flush with the top of the plywood. I engraved with 600dpi recommended settings and had a high level of detail. Finally, I used double-sided tape to attach the micro:bit to the back of the compass rose.


## Next Steps
Extension ideas:
* create a treasure or scavenger hunt
* compare the digital compass to an analog compass for accuracy
* calculate the distance to a fixed point using readings from known points and trigonometry
* make a sundial using the micro:bit to orient it to the right direction
